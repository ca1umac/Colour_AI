create the dataset


--------------------------------------
1. Create/ get a dataset
2. clean the dataset
3. program the backpropagation
4. split the dataset into training validation and test
5. split training into mini batches
6. apply forward and back propagation across all the training data
7. rinse and repeat till its actually working well
8. apply to the validation dataset and do some further tuning
9. apply to the test dataset
10. evaluate success of model
11. consider improvements for future projects
12. go out and get hammered to celebrate
